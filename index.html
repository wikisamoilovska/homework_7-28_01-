                    <p>“I linked up with Stan McQuay in the fall of 2013.
                        At this point I had some small successes and wins in powerlifting and I placed well in a few
                        bodybuilding shows but had yet to win one. Since linking up with Stan I have had 4 class wins, 1
                        overall win, and brought my best physique to the USA stage...
                        Stan has been that guy in that he respects my desire to be very hands on with my prep and that I
                        will probably annoy him with wanting to know "why" we do certain things...instead of just asking
                        what to
                        do. I couldn't be happier being part of Physique Inc and I look forward to continue learning
                        from Stan
                        and all the other people on the coaching staff!”
